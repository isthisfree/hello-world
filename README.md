Taking my lumps like a real tech person
I'm actually getting paid to do this while I'm at work, as we have a fair amount of free time coming up during this current project. That's only because it's snowing like an MFer in Minnesota right now, and we're unable to go out and do the physical portion of the work as we have no transportation. What a ridiculous way to run this job, huh?
